Scaling_mobility_SOCmin.py: Scaling mobility is the code that computes the scaled dataset of trip trajectories and the precomputed SOCmin. 
FASTER_SOC.py: is the code with the implemented smart charging algorithm for a chosen alpha and Ncars. It takes the scaled dataset and SOCmin from Scaling_mobility.py 
Here it is important that several scenarios can be run, so a lot of the code has to be uncommented/commeted dependent on need 
Plot_SOC_mean: plots the mean value of the SOC of all cars in the fleet participating in FASTER_SOC.py--> it shows instability
